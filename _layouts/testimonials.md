      Indra is an excellent realtor. I met Indra through a friend while I was deciding to purchase my first home. First, she developed a great rapport with me and explained everything I needed to know about buying my first home. She is not only a realtor, she is also an educator. She brings everything to the table and gave me choices. She is very skilled in her profession. She combined her knowledge with her experience to help me find the home and location suitable for me. She gave me a list of questions to take to the financial institution that I chose to finance my property. She was professional, ethical, punctual and committed. Indra was very patience with me and I was able to reach her at a moment's call. lf she did not know a question, she would research it and get back to me. She has never pretended or given me false information. Before I met Indra, I was with another realtor. During this time, I was getting frustrated because l was not seeing any progress. I have been seeing homes after homes none of which met my needs. When I decided to take on Indra as my realtor, within a couple of months, I became excited (again) about buying my first home. I was viewing homes that were appropriate to my lifestyle and my budget. Considering that I am a single woman, she listened to my concerns and was very thoughtful in her recommendations.

      Indra did not leave when the deal was done. She picked me up and took me to and from the lawyer for the closing and other transactions. She stayed by my side until the keys were in my hands. Indra was so helpful that she picked up the keys for me, as I was working the night shift and I was too tired on the day to pick up my keys. She contacted the superintendent in the condo building to get information for me to book the elevator on my moving date. She helped me look for a cleaning service to clean the condo before I moved in and she also helped me with choosing my furniture. I was very comfortable and confident working with Indra. I had to hold back on some of my requests because I thought I was expecting too much from her, but she always takes the initiative to make sure that I was alright. I am very happy with the home that Indra helped me choose.

      Anyone who is looking for a realtor to purchase a property, I highly recommend Indra. I am quite sure you will not regret it. Her personality is outstanding and she will pick you up and take you back to your location, it does not matter how late or early it is. She is also a great negotiator and knows how to get the job done. Actually, Indra competence helped me to close before my closing date. Last but not least, Indra saved me thousands in my quest to purchase my new home. I cannot put in words how wonderful Indra is as a person and a realtor. Indra is not only my realtor, she has become my friend.
